<p>The abbr tag allows you to give an inline style to abbreviations.<br>
It is often paired with the title attribute</p>
<br>

<p>You are taking a class that focuses on <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">
HTML </abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>
<hr><hr>

<p>The bold tag allows you to make the content within it appear bolder than the words around it.</p>

<p><b>Bold</b>styling is used to <b>Emphasize</b> certain words and make them <b>stand out</b>from other words.</p>
<hr><hr>

<p>The cite tag is used to identify literary works, publifications, poems, or any other written or produced academic or artwork that you are reffering to.<br>
The cite tag will automatically display content with an italics appearance. However the reason you use the cite tag is because if you want to modify or format<br>
all of your citations at the same time you can just add the cite tag to your CSS External Style Sheet and modify all of them at once.</p>

<p><cite>Relativity </cite> by M.C. Escher is one of my favorite pieces of 2D art.</p>
<hr><hr>
<p>The code tag is used to define a piece of computer code. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.</p>

<p>The HTML <code>button</code> tag defines a clickable button.</p>

<p>The CSS <code>background-color</code> property defines the background color of an element. When books about coding are written, the monospace font is used to signal to the reader than this word refers computer code.</p>

<hr><hr>

<p> The definition tag works similar to the cite tag. It will automatically display content within it in italics, but gives you another tag to give to specific content that you may want to format a specific way on your CSS <abbr title="External Style Sheet"> ESS </abbr> page. </p>

<p><b> Accelerate </b> means <dfn> to begin to move more quickly. </dfn></p>

<hr><hr>

<p> The i tag causes content to be in italics. <p>

<p> Hey look, more <i> italics </i> content on this page. </p>

<hr><hr>

<p>The kbd tag is similar to the code tag. It is used to produce content with a monospace font. The code tag is used to identify code terms in textbooks, the kbd tag is used to identify what you want the user input using the keyboard.</p>

<p>Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy text (Windows).</p>

<p>Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy text(Mac OS).</p>
<hr><hr>
<p>The samp tag is used to define some text as sample output from a computer program<br>
in a document</p>

<p>Message from my computer.</p>

<p><samp>File not found.<br>Press F1 to continue</samp></p>
<hr><hr>
<p> The <small>small tag makes all content within it smaller than the rest of the text </small>, but it respects the same line that the content is on. The next two tags involve content being written below or above the set line for the sentence.</p>

<hr><hr>

<p> The <sub> sub </sub> tag is used to make the content within it small <b><i> AND </b></i> be placed below the line the rest of the sentence is on. This format would be used in Math or Chemistry classes. It refers to subscript text. </p>

<p> Water is H<sub>2</sub>O. </p>

<p><i> Write the following equation in exponential form</i><br>
log <sub>10</sub>0.0001=-3</p>
<hr><hr>
<p>The opposite of the sub tag is the sup tag.</p>

<p>This refers to superscript and is used to make content small <b><i> AND </b></i> lifted above the line the sentence is on. Think about exponents in your Math class. </p>

<p> <b><i> Solve: </b></i> -6<sup>2</sup> + 4 x 3<sup>2</sup> </p>
<hr><hr>

<p> The <strong> strong tag </strong> is basically the same thing as the b tag. The main reason you're seeing this pattern of multiple tags that mean the same thing is because if you wanted the ability <br>
to format your strong sections in a specific manner across your website, but you still want to have the ability to bold other things without the same format as your strong tags, you can do it because you have a second option. </p>

<hr><hr>


<p> The var tag identifies and displays a variable or program output; usually displayed in <i>italics </i> </p>

<p> The area of a triangle is: 1/2 x <var> b </var> x <var>h</var>, where <var>b</var> is the base, and <var>h</var> is the vertical height. </p>.
