<a id="Music Interests"> <p> <h3>Music Interests</h3> </p> </a>
<p> I like Rap, Hiphop, and Phonk </p>
 <p> My favorite artist is probably lil baby </p>
 <p> I'd like to see Drake and Travis Scot doing a show near me because I'm a big fan of them. </p>
 <p> Sicko Mode (by Drake and Travis Scott), Softcore (The neighborhood), and MALA (Manuel AA and 6ix9ine) are the songs I like most currently. </p>
 <p> I do not have much interest for learning any instruments. </p>

 <p> I have been to many awesome places like Puerto Rico, Chicago, and New York. I would love to visit Spain. </p>
 <p> I'm from Winsconsin. I moved here to Florida around 10 years ago. </p>
 <p> My favorite place I've traveled is Puerto Rico. The beaches and the scenery is awesome. The girls are pretty cute too. </p>
 <p> I want to visit Spain, Italy, and Japan because of their incredible architecture, culture, food, sports, and people. </p>

 <a id="Future Me Will Be"> <p> <h3>Future Me Will Be</h3> </p></a>
 <p> My currents plans for the future include school, soccer, and saving money. I call this method the "SSS" plan. </p>
 <p> I am working towards a scholarship in sports to any university (I haven't decided yet). </p>
 <p> My favorite quote is stated by my favorite athlete, Cristiano Ronaldo. He says, "Talent without hard work means nothing". </p>

 <a id="Food"><p> <h3>Food</h3> </p>
 <p> My favrorite food is probably fruits of all kind (but they have to be cold). </p>
 <p> I don't exactly have any special dishes of my own, but I will know how to make anything with instructions. </p>
 <p> My favorite restaurant is Portillo's. Not only because that's my last name but because it simply incredible. </p>
 <p> I have been wanting to go to California Pizza Kitchen for a while because I haven't gone there in a while. </p>

 <a id="After school activities"> <p> <h3>After school activities</h3> </p> </a>
 <p> After school, I like to practice soccer inside and/or outside. Sometimes with friends, sometimes without. I also like to play videogames and watch movies with my mom. </p>
 <p> One thing I would like to start doing daily is to go to the gym. I do plenty of pushups and situps along with my endless soccer practice cardio, but they don't help me build muscle. Maybe in a year or two I will get a gym membership. </p>
